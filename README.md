Samples pour Atelier Clean Architecture 2013 par G. Saint Etienne &amp; T.Cros

===============
I've first started to write some UNCLEAN code to have some bases of code to discuss.

Then you can derive it in DOJOs to work on application of isolation patterns and applying (more) orthogonal architectures.

The CLEAN samples are proposal of solutions to make it clean(ier).
CLEAN solutions should provide tests.

The code samples are for now written in C#, but it would be great to translate them in Java, and why not try ADA for DOJOs.
